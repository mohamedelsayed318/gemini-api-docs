# Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.

## Steps

### 1. Download Node.js

Download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Verify Node.js Installation

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed correctly:

```sh
node -v
npm -v

You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm printed on the terminal.

3. Install Project Packages
Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages by running:
npm install

4. Update API Key
Locate the configuration file (e.g., .env, config.js, or similar) and replace the placeholder API key with your own API key. For example:

5. Run the Project
